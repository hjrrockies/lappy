# Reference-value run — lab notebook

Append-only. Newest entries at the bottom. Records what was tried, what
happened, and why — including dead ends. Companion to `PROTOCOL.md` (how to
resume) and `queue.json` (current state).

Target: 10 Dirichlet eigenvalues per domain, **8+ certified digits**
(Moler–Payne), pushing further where possible.

## Session 1 — harness, and three bugs found before a single reference value

Built `runner.py` (one domain per subprocess, JSON out), `sweep.py` (driver with
per-domain timeout, updates `queue.json`), `status.py` (compact resume view).
One domain per process so a hung domain can never take the run down.

### Finding 1: `minimize_on_bracket` crashes on degenerate brackets

`square` — the *easiest* domain in the suite — died with
`ValueError: x not increasing!` from `opt.parabolic_iter_min`.

`opt.minimize_on_bracket` guards the bracket *width* (`x[2]-x[0] > tol`) but not
that the interior point is strictly inside. Where `sigma` is flat to machine
precision over a range — which is exactly what a high-multiplicity eigenvalue
looks like — `bracket_mins` can return `x[1] == x[0]`, and
`parabolic_iter_min` raises rather than degrading gracefully.

The function *already* has a golden-search fallback for when parabolic
interpolation fails; it simply never reached it. Fixed by routing degenerate
brackets straight there (golden search needs only the two endpoints).
**Behavior changes only on inputs that previously raised**, so nothing that
worked before can regress.

`lappy/opt.py`. This one is worth remembering: it would bite any user solving a
symmetric domain, and the failure mode is a hard crash, not a bad number.

### Finding 2: certified digits and true error can disagree completely

With the crash fixed, `square` returned **13.3 certified digits and 0.2 digits
against its closed form.** Both numbers were correct.

Moler–Payne certifies that *some* eigenvalue lies within the stated distance —
not that the *k*-th one does. The full-domain path returns **distinct**
eigenvalues with multiplicity in a separate array; the reference tables count
multiplicity. Comparing them elementwise misaligns everything after the first
degeneracy. Every returned value was accurate to ~13 digits; the list was just
short by one entry at position 2.

Fixed in `runner.py` by expanding by multiplicity before comparing, and
recording `n_distinct` alongside `n_found`.

**This is the case for the analytic tier existing.** Certification alone would
have reported a clean 13-digit success on a wrong table. Nothing else in the
pipeline — not tension, not Weyl, not certification — would have caught it.

### Finding 3: symmetry reduction does not split every degeneracy

`domain_symmetry` had no entry for `rect`, `eq_tri`, `iso_right_tri`, `disk`,
`disk_sector` or `parallelogram` — 14 suite domains forced onto the slow
full-domain path. Registered all six (new entries only; no existing entry
touched) and wrote `tests/test_symmetry.py`, which `symmetry.py`'s docstring has
always referenced but which never existed. It checks every group element maps
the boundary to itself, calibrated against the identity's own error, because
`bdry.dist` measures against the adaptive polyline and so reports ~1e-8 relative
even for the identity on curved domains. 117 checks, all 39 groups pass.

That exposed the real issue. `solve_sym` collected per-sector multiplicities
from `manual_solve` and **discarded** them, documenting that "repeated
eigenvalues across distinct sectors *are* the multiplicity". That is only true
when the registered group splits every degeneracy.

`SymmetryGroup` supports only real characters, i.e. elementary abelian
2-groups — which can be strictly smaller than the domain's true symmetry. The
square is the clean example: under `rect D2`, the double (1,2)/(2,1) splits
across sectors, but (1,3)/(3,1) are both odd-odd and land in the **same**
sector. Splitting them needs the diagonal reflection that D4 has and D2 does
not.

So multiplicity has two independent sources and both are needed:
across-sector *and* within-sector. Patched `solve_sym` to expand by the
per-sector estimate it was already computing.

**General rule for this run:** whenever the true symmetry group is larger than
the registered real-character subgroup, expect residual within-sector
degeneracy. Affects `square`, the regular n-gons (D_n vs D2), `disk` (O(2)),
`eq_tri` (D3 vs one mirror).

### Early numbers (certified / analytic digits)

    L_shape        13.6            (certified only)
    eq_tri         13.6 / 14.4
    disk           13.7 / 14.5
    square         13.7 / (see above — rerunning after the multiplicity fix)

`eq_tri` and `disk` agreeing to 14+ digits against closed forms is a good sign
for the pipeline itself: where the bookkeeping is right, the numbers are right.
